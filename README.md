<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/CzSFbVN/ToDo.png)

- What was my experience?

  my experience was very satisfactory, making use of the localStorage to give a better user experience, looking for solutions to comprehension problems that were presented, but, despite that, the whole process of development was very enriching.

- What have I learned/improved?

  I learned the use of the useEffect hook, the handling of the LocalStorage, conditional renders among other topics that were of great importance when solving this challenge.

- My wisdom? :)
  I knew how to use React, SASS but not in a deep way, I had topics to learn and thanks to this challenge I have enriched my knowledge.
